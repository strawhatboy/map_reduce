The grep program scans through 1010 100-byte records, searching for a relatively rare three-character pattern (the pattern occurs in 92,337 records). The input is split into approximately 64MB pieces (M = 15000), and the entire output is placed in one file (R = 1). Figure 2 shows the progress of the computation over
time. The Y-axis shows the rate at which the input data is scanned. The rate gradually picks up as more machines are assigned to this MapReduce computation, and peaks at over 30 GB/s when 1764 workers have been assigned. As the map tasks finish, the rate starts dropping and hits zero about 80 seconds into the computation. The entire computation takes approximately 150 seconds from start to finish. This includes about a minute of startup overhead. The overhead is due to the propagation of the program to all worker machines, and delays interacting with GFS to open the set of 1000 input files and to get the information needed for the locality optimization

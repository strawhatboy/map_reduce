In Figure 3 (c), we show an execution of the sort program where we intentionally killed 200 out of 1746 worker processes several minutes into the computation. The underlying cluster scheduler immediately restarted new worker processes on these machines (since only the processes were killed, the machines were still functioning properly). The worker deaths show up as a negative input rate
since some previously completed map work disappears (since the corresponding map workers were killed) and needs to be redone. The re-execution of this map work happens relatively quickly. The entire computation finishes in 933 seconds including startup overhead (just an increase of 5% over the normal execution time).
